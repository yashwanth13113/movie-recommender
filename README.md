🎬 Movie Recommender System

A Machine Learning-based recommender system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences.  
Built using "Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and cosine similarity", this project demonstrates the application of recommendation algorithms in the entertainment domain.
 📌 Features
	• Content-based filtering** using movie metadata (genres, keywords, cast, director)
	• Cosine similarity** to measure closeness between movies
	• Interactive search** to get top similar movie recommendations
	• Data preprocessing & cleaning** for accurate results
	• Scalable** to include collaborative filtering in the future
